# IntentRec4Maps

In this demonstration, we develop a system to recognise users' intentions in interactive maps for real-world navigation. Our system uses the Google Maps Platform as the real-world interactive map, and it employs a very effective recognition approach for recognising users' intentions in real-time. 
We show the efficiency of recognition problems with different numbers of intentions and observations, and evaluate the recognition process of our system using two different Path-Planners and a Large Language Model (LLM).
